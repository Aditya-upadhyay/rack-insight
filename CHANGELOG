    * MagicInsight!  WARNING: Magic is dangerous.

      * MagicInsight is a new mixin that can be used by any 'stat' type class built for Rack::Bug / LogicalInsight / Rack::Insight.
        Just include Rack::Insight::MagicInsight in your stat class and then to render call:

            render_template 'magic_panel', :magic_insights => your_stat_object, :name => 'panel name'

        Read the source for Rack::Insight::MagicInsight and heed the warnings.
        MagicInsight is used internally by Rack::Insight for magic panels and the templates panel.

    * panel content now stays out of your page content, by displaying below it.

    * Fixed the hardly working TemplatesPanel (Issue 1)

  * New Features

    * Extension gems now automatically look for their view templates
      relative to the panel class file that tries to render them.
    * Two levels of log verbosity filtering to allow re-use of the Rails log, but to not force same level output from
      rack-insight as the rails log is set to for the env.  It will never be more logging than Rails log's env level,
      but it can, and usually should, be less.

  * Fixed a number of bugs, and refactored some things.  Please let me know if you use it/break it!

== 0.5.0 / 2012-08-29 - transition to rack_insight (Peter Boling)

  * Compatibility

    * Restructure gem so Insight is inside a namespace, because I have classes named Insight that are obscured by
      logical_insight gem when loaded.  Logical also seemed like it may be a class name somewhere, hence going back to
      the Rack namespace a la rack-bug.  Keeping the (now nested) Insight namespace as well, because - genetics.
