== 0.5.5 / 2012-08-31 (Peter Boling)

  * New Features

    * Extension gems now automatically look for their view templates
      relative to the panel class file that tries to render them.
    * Two levels of log verbosity filtering to allow re-use of the Rails log, but to not force same level output from
      rack-insight as the rails log is set to for the env.  It will never be more logging than Rails log's env level,
      but it can, and usually should, be less.

  * Fixed a number of bugs, and refactored some things.  Please let me know if you use it/break it!

== 0.5.0 / 2012-08-29 - transition to rack_insight (Peter Boling)

  * Compatibility

    * Restructure gem so Insight is inside a namespace, because I have classes named Insight that are obscured by
      logical_insight gem when loaded.  Logical also seemed like it may be a class name somewhere, hence going back to
      the Rack namespace a la rack-bug.  Keeping the (now nested) Insight namespace as well, because - genetics.
